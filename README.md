# Jekyllplate
[![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/stphn/Jekyllplate.svg)](https://david-dm.org/stphn/Jekyllplate#info=dependencies)

Just another boilerplate for static Jekyll sites using gulp automations.

It includes webpack for JS bundling and ES2015 transforms, SCSS injection and auto-reload with BrowserSync, and a lot of other useful tasks.

### Pre-requisites
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

### Installation
1. **Install dependencies listed above**
1. Fork and clone this repo
1. `cd` into the directory
1. Run `npm start` to install other dependencies
1. Run `gulp serve` to start the file watching!

### Writing Posts
To add new drafts, add a file in the `posts/_drafts` directory that follows the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary YAML front matter:

    ---
    layout: post
    title:  Example draft
    date:   2017-01-01 00:00:00 +0000
    categories: example
    tags: example-tag
    ---

Once you're ready to publish this draft, move the file to `posts/_posts`.

### Creating Pages
Create new pages in the root directory (or pretty much any subdirectory). The filename will form part of the URL.

Pages will need [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) as well, for example:

    ---
    layout: default
    title: Example Page
    permalink: /examples/
    nav: true
    ---

Only pages with `nav` set to `true` will appear in the top navigation. Easy.

### Deployment
This is automatically ready to deploy, so long as the `gulp` server has been running during development.

Built code lives in the `_site` directory. Deploy this to the `prod` branch with `gulp deploy`.

### Still todo

*  Include Open Graph protocols

*  clean up

*  and probably a lot more ...
